# Installation

## First-Time Setup

1) Download the latest `Guilds-x.x.jar` file from either the SpigotMC page or the development build page. You can find the latest version from SpigotMC [right here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.66176/)!
2) Locate your server's plugin directory, then place the Guilds jar you grabbed in the previous step into that folder!
3) Start your server and then step it again so that the plugin can generate all the data it needs to. You can now find the config in `/Guilds/config.yml`!
4) Make any chances you need to the config, then save it.
5) Start the server back up and you'll be ready to rock and roll!

## Requirements

### Plugin Dependencies

Guilds has a single plugin dependency which is [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/). Please make sure this plugin is on your server before you try and start Guilds, or it will NOT start!

### Server Dependencies

**CPU:** The plugin will run perfectly fine on basically any CPU. It's optimized to be smooth and non-intensive to the server it runs on.

**RAM:** Guilds will uses fairly little RAM. You should expect to see a usage of at least 256MB on startup from the plguin and depending on how many Guilds you have on the server, it could be a little higher.

**Disk Space:** Guilds uses very little space. It's optimized to keep itself clean and not bloat up your drive.
