#### `announcements`{#config-option}

The part of the config that controls the announcements from the plugin developer to servers OPs and Owners.

This can be used in a few instances such as letting them know of an important bug to be aware of, if there's an update ready to go, or general messages that the developer finds important for the users to know.

**Example**

```YAML
console: true
in-game: true
```
___

#### `messagesLanguage`{#config-option}

Choosing your language for the plugin is pretty simple. In the language folder (`/Guilds/languages/`), you can see a list of all the languages that are currently in the plugin. Please understand that not all languages are fully translated, but you can finish a translation and submit it if interested!

**Example**
```YAML
messagesLanguage: en-US
```
___

#### `player-update-languages`{#config-option}  

Would you like to allow admin players to update the languages via command?  
If yes, set to true, and they will be able to run /guild admin update-languages  
If no, set to false, and the command will only run via console.  

**Example**
```YAML
 player-update-languages: false
 ```
 ___

 #### `save-interval`{#config-option}  

 How often (in minutes) do you want all Guild Data to save?  

 **Example**
 ```YAML
 save-interval: 1
 ```
 ___


#### `update-check`{#config-option}

Would you like to check for plugin updates on startup? It's highly suggested you keep this enabled!

**Example**
```YAML
update-check: true
```
___
### Hooks

#### `essentials-chat`{#config-option}

Do we want to hook into Essentials-Chat format to handle guild placeholders?

**Example**
```YAML
essentials-chat: false
```
___

#### `worldguard-claims`{#config-option}

Do we want to hook into WorldGuard to allow claiming land?

**Example**
```YAML
worldguard-claims: false
```
___
### GUIs

#### `Guild List`{#config-option}

Detailed explanation and configuration of how the Guild List works.

**Example**

        gui-name: Guild List
        # What should the name of the all the items be in the inventory?

creation: 0.0
# How much should it cost to set the cost of the guild home?
sethome: 0.0
```
___

### Claims

This section of the config will allow you to handle guild land claiming. Remember that the enable / disable for this is the WorldGuard Hook at the TOP of the config. here are multiple options when it comes to guild claims. For the time being, all guilds will only get one claim. (Soon to be expected to change in 3.5 or 3.6)

#### `Radius`{#config-option}

This is the number of blocks around the player it will try to create the region. Keep in mind this is the RADIUS, it will go this many blocks in both directions. For example, if you take the default 15, it'll do 30 total as it will go 15 blocks in both directions. This is a CUBOID region, not SPHERE.

```YAML
radius: 15
```

enabled: false
# Would you like to display a user's display name instead of their MC username?
display-name: false
```
___

#### `Format`{#config-option}

Change how the Prefixes in the TabList show!

format: '&7[&b{guild}&7]&r'

### Tiers

This section of the config will talk about various parts of upgrading a guild and allow you to choose how it works. For "mob-xp-multiplier" the default is 1, meaning that it will drop the normal amount of XP for non-upgraded guilds. DO NOT set it to 0, that will either throw errors or cause mobs to not drop XP. Keep in mind for the damage-multiplier, it applies to players also, so by default it's set to normal for every tier.

**Example**
```YAML
carry-over: true
```
